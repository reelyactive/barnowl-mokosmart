barnowl-mokosmart
=================

__barnowl-mokosmart__ converts the decodings of _any_ ambient Bluetooth Low Energy devices by [MOKOSmart](https://www.mokosmart.com/) gateways into standard developer-friendly JSON that is vendor/technology/application-agnostic.

![Overview of barnowl-mokosmart](https://reelyactive.github.io/barnowl-mokosmart/images/overview.png)

__barnowl-mokosmart__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl-mokosmart) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices as well as on powerful cloud servers and anything in between.  It is included in reelyActive's [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware suite, and can just as easily be run standalone behind a [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) instance, as detailed in the code examples below.


Getting Started
---------------

Learn "owl" about the __raddec__ JSON data output:
-  [reelyActive Developer's Cheatsheet](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/)


Quick Start
-----------

Clone this repository, install package dependencies with `npm install`, and then from the root folder run at any time:

    npm start

__barnowl-mokosmart__ will attempt to connect to a local MQTT server (mqtt://localhost) and subscribe to the mokosmart topic, outputting _raddec_ and _infrastructureMessage_ data to the console.


Is that owl you can do?
-----------------------

While __barnowl-mokosmart__ may suffice standalone for simple real-time applications, its functionality can be greatly extended with the following software packages:
- [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib) to decode the individual packets from hexadecimal strings into JSON
- [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) to combine parallel streams of RF decoding data in a technology-and-vendor-agnostic way

These packages and more are bundled together as the [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere) open source middleware suite, which includes a variety of __barnowl-x__ listeners, APIs and interactive web apps.
